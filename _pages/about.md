I’m an agroclimatologist studying the dynamics of climate variability and its relation to food security using reanalysis products, remote  sensing observations and model simulations. I’ve recently been working on how global-scale modes of climate variability pose a risk to major agricultural production regions. I am currently an [Earth Institute Fellow](earth.columbia.edu/articles/view/58#Anderson) working on climate and food security with [Lisa Goddard](https://iri.columbia.edu/contact/staff-directory/lisa-goddard/) and  [Walter Baethgen](https://iri.columbia.edu/contact/staff-directory/walter-baethgen/) at the [IRI](https://iri.columbia.edu/).

Conflict, drought, and locusts have been leading concerns for African food security in recent years, but the relative importance and spatiotemporal scales of crises resulting from each hazard is poorly characterized. Here we use continuous, subnational data from Sub-Saharan Africa to characterize how food crises differ according to livelihood strategy in response to each hazard. We find that when exposed to drought, pastoralists experienced more widespread, severe, and long-lasting food crises compared to those in agricultural zones. From 2009-2013 drought was the primary trigger of food security crises in all non-riverine zones; after 2013 conflict-related food security crises become prevalent. The few confirmed famines coincided with both conflict and drought.

## The Madden-Julian Oscillation and food security

<br/>
  While many Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) teleconnections are well documented, the significance of these teleconnections to agriculture is not well understood. We first estimate how the MJO affects the climate during crop flowering seasons, when crops are particularly vulnerable to abiotic stress. We then use crop models and observational yield statistics to demonstrate that in dry, hot, environments the MJO can lead to crop failures by reducing precipitation, decreasing soil moisture, and increasing extreme heat. In wetter, cooler environments – where water stress is less common – MJO-forced decreases in rainfall bring increases in solar radiation that benefits crop yields.

## Synchronous crop failures and climate-forced production variability 

![](https://WestonAnderson.github.io/images/SynchronousFailures.png)
<br/>
Large-scale modes of climate variability can force widespread crop yield anomalies, and are therefore often presented as a risk to food security. We find that the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), tropical Atlantic variability (TAV) and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) together account for 18%, 7% and 6% of globally aggregated maize, soybean and wheat production variability, respectively. The lower fractions of global-scale soybean and wheat production variability result from significant but offsetting climate-forced production anomalies. All climate modes are important in at least one region studied. In 1983, ENSO, the only mode capable of forcing globally-synchronous crop failures, was responsible for the largest synchronous crop failure in the modern historical record. Our results provide the basis for monitoring, and potentially predicting, simultaneous crop failures.

<br/>
This is review article on the varied climate impacts of ENSO on South America, and why those impacts are important to society. It was written by a team of exceptional South American scientists, who generously included myself as an early career scientist.

### The global-scale structure of the risk posed by ENSO to agriculture<br/>
![](https://WestonAnderson.github.io/images/AMENSO_ylds_Corr-768x576.png)

<br/>

The El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) has proven to be a major driver of global crop yield variability, at times responsible for simultaneous crop failures in multiple countries. ENSO and its associated teleconnections evolve over multiple years at a basin-wide scale. These analyses are the first attempt to characterize the structure of the risk posed by ENSO teleconnections to wheat, maize and soybean production.

## Drought Monitoring in East Africa<br/>

![](https://WestonAnderson.github.io/images/drought_monitor.png)
<br/>
Drought in East Africa is a recurring phenomenon with significant humanitarian impacts. Given the steep climatic gradients, topographic contrasts and general data scarcity that characterizes the region, there is a need for spatially distributed, remotely derived monitoring systems to inform national and international drought response. In this analysis we apply a suite of remote monitoring techniques to characterize the temporal and spatial evolution of the2010–2011 Horn of Africa drought.
