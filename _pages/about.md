I’m an agroclimatologist studying the dynamics of climate variability and its relation to food security using reanalysis products, remote  sensing observations and model simulations. I’ve recently been working on how global-scale modes of climate variability pose a risk to major agricultural production regions. I am currently an [Earth Institute Fellow](earth.columbia.edu/articles/view/58#Anderson) working on climate and food security with [Lisa Goddard](https://iri.columbia.edu/contact/staff-directory/lisa-goddard/) and  [Walter Baethgen](https://iri.columbia.edu/contact/staff-directory/walter-baethgen/) at the [IRI](https://iri.columbia.edu/). For more information on my professional activities and my research see my Publications page, [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RP8M1g8AAAAJ&hl=en), or see my [CV](https://WestonAnderson.github.io/files/Weston_Buckley_Anderson_CV_2020.pdf)



# Recent Research

### The Madden-Julian Oscillation and food security
MJO teleconnections to crop growing seasons [PDF](https://WestonAnderson.github.io/files/WBA_MJO_Ag_Tele.pdf), [link](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00382-019-05109-0)<br/>

  While many Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) teleconnections are well documented, the significance of these teleconnections to agriculture is not well understood. We analyze how the MJO affects the climate during crop flowering seasons, when crops are particularly vulnerable to abiotic stress. The MJO significantly affects not only daily average precipitation and soil moisture, but also the probability of extreme precipitation, soil moisture and maximum temperatures during crop flowering seasons.

  We use crop models and observational yield statistics to assess whether the MJO affects maize yields. We find that the influence of the MJO is widespread, affecting crop yields throughout the tropics. In dry, hot environments the MJO can lead to crop failures by reducing precipitation, decreasing soil moisture, and increasing extreme heat, while in wetter, cooler environments – where water stress is less common – MJO-forced decreases in rainfall bring increases in solar radiation that benefits crop yields.

### Synchronous crop failures and climate-forced production variability [pdf](https://WestonAnderson.github.io/files/Anderson2019_synchronous.pdf), [SI pdf](https://WestonAnderson.github.io/files/Anderson2019_synchronous_SI.pdf)

![](https://WestonAnderson.github.io/images/SynchronousFailures.png)

Large-scale modes of climate variability can force widespread crop yield anomalies, and are therefore often presented as a risk to food security. We find that the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), tropical Atlantic variability (TAV) and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) together account for 18%, 7% and 6% of globally aggregated maize, soybean and wheat production variability, respectively. The lower fractions of global-scale soybean and wheat production variability result from significant but offsetting climate-forced production anomalies. All climate modes are important in at least one region studied. In 1983, ENSO, the only mode capable of forcing globally-synchronous crop failures, was responsible for the largest synchronous crop failure in the modern historical record. Our results provide the basis for monitoring, and potentially predicting, simultaneous crop failures.

# The El Niño Southern Oscillation and agriculture
Below is a collection of research projects focused on ENSO and agriculture

### ENSO Review <br/>
Climate impacts of the El Niño Southern Oscillation on South America [PDF](https://WestonAnderson.github.io/files/enso_SA.pdf), [link](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43017-020-0040-3)<br/>

![](https://WestonAnderson.github.io/images/ensoSA.png)

This is review article on the varied climate impacts of ENSO on South America, and why those impacts are important to society. It was written by a team of exceptional South American scientists, who generously included myself as an early career scientist.

### Trans-Pacific ENSO teleconnections pose a correlated risk to global agriculture [pdf](https://WestonAnderson.github.io/files/Anderson2018transpacific.pdf)

![](https://WestonAnderson.github.io/images/Transpacific.png)

Life cycles of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and its associated teleconnections evolve over multiple years at a basin-wide scale. This analysis is the first attempt to characterize the structure of the risk posed by trans-Pacific ENSO teleconnections to wheat, maize and soybean production. We find that ENSO poses a correlated risk to crop production in the greater Pacific basin. Most ENSO teleconnections relevant for crop flowering seasons are the result of a single trans-Pacific circulation anomaly that forms in response to a tropical Matsuno-Gill-type response to SST forcing. Trans-Pacific ENSO teleconnections are often (but not always) offsetting between major producing regions in the Americas and those in China or Australia.

### Life cycles of agriculturally-relevant ENSO teleconnections in North and South America [pdf](https://WestonAnderson.github.io/files/Anderson2016lifecycles.pdf)

The El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) has proven to be a major driver of global crop yield variability, at times responsible for simultaneous crop failures in multiple countries. However, the temperature and precipitation teleconnections attributable to ENSO are systematic, and therefore present an opportunity to improve planning at large scales. Here we analyze how multi-year ENSO life-cycles lead to correlated risks for major crop-producing countries in North and South America.

### Crop production variability in North and South America forced by life-cycles of the El Niño Southern Oscillation [pdf](https://WestonAnderson.github.io/files/Anderson2017crop.pdf)  AMENSO_ylds_Corr

![](https://WestonAnderson.github.io/images/AMENSO_ylds_Corr-768x576.png)

In this analysis we show how globally coherent teleconnections from ENSO life-cycles lead to correlated crop production anomalies in North and South America. We estimate the magnitude of ENSO-induced Pan-American production anomalies and discuss how increasing crop harvesting frequency may increase Pan-American production variability, which we demonstrate has occurred in regions of Brazil that have shifted to a safrinha cropping cycle.

## Drought Monitoring

### Towards an integrated soil moisture drought monitor for East Africa [pdf](https://WestonAnderson.github.io/files/Anderson2012drought.pdf)

![](https://WestonAnderson.github.io/images/drought_monitor.png)

Drought in East Africa is a recurring phenomenon with significant humanitarian impacts. Given the steep climatic gradients, topographic contrasts and general data scarcity that characterizes the region, there is a need for spatially distributed, remotely derived monitoring systems to inform national and international drought response. In this analysis we apply a suite of remote monitoring techniques to characterize the temporal and spatial evolution of the2010–2011 Horn of Africa drought.
