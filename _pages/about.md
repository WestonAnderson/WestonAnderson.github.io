I’m an agroclimatologist studying the dynamics of climate variability and its relation to food security using reanalysis products, remote  sensing observations and model simulations. I’ve recently been working on how global-scale modes of climate variability pose a risk to major agricultural production regions. I am currently an [Earth Institute Fellow](earth.columbia.edu/articles/view/58#Anderson) working on climate and food security with [Lisa Goddard](https://iri.columbia.edu/contact/staff-directory/lisa-goddard/) and  [Walter Baethgen](https://iri.columbia.edu/contact/staff-directory/walter-baethgen/) at the [IRI](https://iri.columbia.edu/). For more information on my professional activities and my research see my Publications page, [Google Scholar](scholar.google.com/citations?user=RP8M1g8AAAAJ&hl=en), or see my [CV](https://WestonAnderson.github.io/files/Weston_Buckley_Anderson_CV_2019.pdf)
